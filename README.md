*You are standing in an open field west of a white house.* The Great Underground Empire, with its treasures, grues, and twisty little passages, rebuilt in .NET. One executable, any platform. No pictures. Just words and your imagination.

## Original source

The game originates from the 1977 version of Zork created at MIT by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling. The **1977 source code** is preserved and published by MIT’s Department of Distinctive Collections (DDC):

- **[MITDDC/zork](https://github.com/MITDDC/zork)** Source code for the 1977 version of Zork (MDL, from the [Tapes of Tech Square (ToTS)](https://archivesspace.mit.edu/repositories/2/archival_objects/347748) collection).

This repository is an independent reimplementation in C#/.NET and is not affiliated with MIT or Infocom.
